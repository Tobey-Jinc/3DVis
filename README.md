This software is intended for use with getReal3D and The CAVE.

## Installation/Setup
1.	Ensure CAVE2 is in 3D mode.
2.	The 3DVis Application requires the network folder “\\CAVE-HEADNODE\data” to be online and accessible to the Headnode and render nodes.
3.	The 3DVis Application has a dedicated GitHub repository for the builds, download and unzip the latest build onto the Headnode from: 
https://github.com/Tobey-Jinc/3DVis/releases  
4.	Open trackd tracking (trackd 5.9 (status) located on the desktop) and getReal4 (Get-real-4 located on the desktop).
5.	In the getReal3D launcher, click on the configuration tab and ensure the configuration is set to “Sunshine Coast – CAVE2 2024-nohead”, if it does not exist, press the plus icon and add the “ssc_cave2_2024_nohead.gr3d” file located in the 3DVis GitHub. This disabled head tracking and sets the static head height correctly.
6.	Click on the Cluster Games List tab, press the “+” icon and add the 3DVis Application by selecting the exe in the 3DVis folder previously downloaded.
7.	Once synced you can launch the game, you may get a warning on the first launch the getReal3D version is incorrect, press “Replace and Run”. You may need to select a different game and then click back onto 3DVis to launch.
8.	To close the application, press the stop button on the getReal3D launcher
9.	To update/remove, with 3DVis selected, click on the “–” icon in the getReal3D launcher to remove. Repeat steps 1-6 to reinstall a new version.
10.	When using the controller ensure the mode button is off (can be turned off by pressing the mode button on the controller).
